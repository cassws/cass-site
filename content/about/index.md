My goal is to help learners, researchers, and communities engage meaningfully (and critically!) with **data**. 

I participate and collaborate in **open source ecosystems**, especially in the domains of open science, digital scholarship, and civic data. I strive to advocate for **justice** in worker and learner communities.


## How I work:

* **Consult** with learners and researchers in all aspects of data work
* **Develop** open source tools & platforms in Python/R/Ruby/js
* **Research** learner & user experiences with mixed methods
* **Maintain** tools, projects, and communities

## My current roles:

I work as the **Data Instructional Specialist** at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. I'm also a **Fellow (2019-2021)** in the IMLS-funded [Visualizing the Future initiative](https://visualizingthefuture.github.io/)

✨✨ In January and February 2021, I'm **attending [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)!** Yay! ✨✨

## Creative/hobby/dork pursuits

I am learning to skateboard! In general I love sports (frisbee, basketball, etc.) I also play a little competitive pinball. I also make short narrative games [like this one](https://jamforleelah81.itch.io/reparative) and am planning to experiment more with narrative/experimental games/TTRPGs/etc. More to come!

## Previous roles:

I worked as a social sicence data librarian at Cornell University, as a programmer/analyst and data visualization intern at the University of Michigan, and as a research assistant at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University.
